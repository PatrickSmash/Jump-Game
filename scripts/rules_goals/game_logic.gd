## This is the GameLogic script - it controls the rules of the game
## It decides when the player wins or loses, manages the timer,
## and handles game restarts. Think of it as the "referee" of the game.

## How many coins to collect for winning?

## Recursively finds all coin objects in the scene tree
## This is used to count total coins when coins_to_win is set to 0
## 
## How it works:
## - Starts with a parent node (usually the main scene)
## - Checks if the current node is a Coin
## - If it is, adds it to the accumulator array
## - Then checks all children of this node recursively
## - Returns an array containing all coin objects found

	if node is Coin:
		accumulator.append(node)
	
	# Check all children of this node

		get_all_coins(child, accumulator)  # Recursive call
